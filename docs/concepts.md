# Concepts

HeXtractor is built upon several core concepts that enable the efficient transformation of tabular data into heterogeneous graphs. These concepts are crucial for understanding how the tool operates and how it can be effectively utilized in various research and practical applications.

## Graph Specifications and Relationships

A Graph Specification (Graph Spec) in HeXtractor can encompass multiple Data Source Specifications (Data Source Specs). Each Data Source Spec can include Node Parameters (Node Params), Edge Parameters (Edge Params), and the data source itself. This hierarchical structure allows for flexible and comprehensive graph construction from diverse data sources.

Consider a single graph that includes one data source specification: a data frame. This data frame consists of two types of nodes: `employee` and `company`. Specific columns in the data frame serve as attributes for each node type. For instance, `employee` attributes might include `employee_occupation`, `employee_age`, and `employee_promotion`, while `company` attributes might include `company_employees` and `company_revenue`. The relationship between these nodes is defined as `company --employs--> employee`, which is established using the `company_id` and `employee_id` columns.

This example demonstrates the flexibility and precision of HeXtractor in transforming tabular data into a structured heterogeneous graph, facilitating advanced data analysis and visualization.

## Tabular Data to Heterogeneous Graphs

The primary function of HeXtractor is to convert tabular data into heterogeneous graphs. This process involves identifying unique entities and relationships within the data and representing them as nodes and edges in a graph. The tool handles both single-table and multi-table data cases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to different data structures.

### Single-Table Data Case

In the single-table data case, all data is contained within a single table. Each row represents a relationship between entities, which may result in duplication of entities across rows. HeXtractor de-duplicates the data, extracting only unique entities and their relationships. This process involves defining node and edge parameters to specify how entities and relationships are constructed.

### Multi-Table Data Case

In the multi-table data case, data is distributed across multiple tables, each representing a different entity type. This is typical of relational databases or normalized data warehouses. HeXtractor extracts graphs from such data by defining node and edge parameters for each table separately. Multiple data source specifications are used to construct a comprehensive graph from the distributed data.

## Graph Specifications

Graph specifications are central to the operation of HeXtractor. They instruct the tool on how to construct each entity and relationship within the graph. The specifications include:

1. **Node Type Parameters**: Define how to build specific, unique nodes (e.g., companies, employees).
2. **Edge Type Parameters**: Define how to build specific, unique edges (e.g., company-employee relationships).
3. **Data Source Specifications**: Contain multiple node and edge type parameters, specifying the types of entities and relationships that can be found in the data.
4. **Graph Specifications**: Contain multiple data source specifications, guiding HeXtractor in building a single graph from the provided data

## LangChain LLMs integration

HeXtractor can be integrated with LangChain Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the extraction and analysis of structured data from unstructured text. By combining the capabilities of HeXtractor in transforming tabular data into graphs with LangChain's natural language processing capabilities, users can extract valuable insights from a wide range of data sources, including text documents, web pages, and social media content.

In order to turn textual data into heterogeneous graph, the following steps are required:
1. Confugure LLM compatible with `LLMGraphTransformer`.
2. Extract GraphDocument from text.
3. Pass GraphDocument to `convert_graph_document_to_hetero_data(graph_doc)` function.

Example can be found below:

```python
base_url = "YOUR_BASE_URL"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

llm = ChatOpenAI(base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key)
llm_graph_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm)
```

Example usage:

```python
text = """Filip WÃ³jcik and Marcin Malczewski are data scientists, who developed HeXtractor. It is a library
that helps in extracting heterogeneous knowledge graphs from various data source.
Heterogeneous knowledge graphs are graphs that contain different types of nodes and edges."""

docs = [Document(page_content=text)]

data = await llm_graph_transformer.aconvert_to_graph_documents(docs)

graph_doc = data[0]
convert_graph_document_to_hetero_data(graph_doc)
```

## Example Workflow

An example workflow using HeXtractor involves the following steps:

1. **Load Libraries**: Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. **Prepare Data**: Load and prepare the tabular data.
3. **Define Graph Specifications**: Create node and edge type parameters, data source specifications, and graph specifications.
4. **Extract Graph**: Use HeXtractor to extract the graph based on the defined specifications.
5. **Visualize Graph**: Utilize visualization tools such as NetworkX and PyVis to visualize the extracted graph.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Process
