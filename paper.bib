Meanwhile, representation learning (a.k.a. embedding) has recently been intensively studied and shown effective for various network mining and analytical tasks. In this work, we aim to provide a unified framework to deeply summarize and evaluate existing research on heterogeneous network embedding (HNE), which includes but goes beyond a normal survey. Since there has already been a broad body of HNE algorithms, as the first contribution of this work, we provide a generic paradigm for the systematic categorization and analysis over the merits of various existing HNE algorithms. Moreover, existing HNE algorithms, though mostly claimed generic, are often evaluated on different datasets. As the second contribution, we create four benchmark datasets with various properties regarding scale, structure, attribute/label availability, and etc. from different sources, towards handy and fair evaluations of HNE algorithms. As the third contribution, we carefully refactor and amend the implementations and create friendly interfaces for eleven popular HNE algorithms, and provide all-around comparisons among them over multiple tasks and experimental settings.},

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

In this work, we present a systematical reproduction of 12 recent HGNNs by using their official codes, datasets, settings, and hyperparameters, revealing surprising findings about the progress of HGNNs. We find that the simple homogeneous GNNs, e.g., GCN and GAT, are largely underestimated due to improper settings. GAT with proper inputs can generally match or outperform all existing HGNNs across various scenarios. To facilitate robust and reproducible HGNN research, we construct the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) , consisting of 11 diverse datasets with three tasks. HGB standardizes the process of heterogeneous graph data splits, feature processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce a simple but very strong baseline Simple-HGN-which significantly outperforms all previous models on HGB-to accelerate the advancement of HGNNs in the future.}

In particular, for each representative HG embedding method, we provide detailed introduction and further analyze its pros and cons; meanwhile, we also explore the transformativeness and applicability of different types of HG embedding methods in the real-world industrial environments for the first time. In addition, we further present several widely deployed systems that have demonstrated the success of HG embedding techniques in resolving real-world application problems with broader impacts. To facilitate future research and applications in this area, we also summarize the open-source code, existing graph learning platforms and benchmark datasets.

As for alleviating the sparsity and cold start problems encountered by recommender systems, researchers generally resort to employing side information or knowledge in recommendation as a strategy for uncovering hidden (indirect) user-item relations, aiming to enrich observed information (or data) for recommendation. However, in the face of the high complexity and large scale of side information and knowledge, this strategy largely relies for efficient implementation on the scalability of recommendation models. Not until after the prevalence of machine learning did graph embedding techniques be a recent concentration, which can efficiently utilize complex and large-scale data. In light of that, equipping recommender systems with graph embedding techniques has been widely studied these years, appearing to outperform conventional recommendation implemented directly based on graph topological analysis (or resolution). As the focus, this article systematically retrospects graph embedding-based recommendation from embedding techniques for bipartite graphs, general graphs and knowledge graphs, and proposes a general design pipeline of that. In addition, after comparing several representative graph embedding-based recommendation models with the most common-used conventional recommendation models on simulations, this article manifests that the conventional models can still overall outperform the graph embedding-based ones in predicting implicit user-item interactions, revealing the comparative weakness of graph embedding-based recommendation in these tasks. To foster future research, this article proposes constructive suggestions on making a trade-off between graph embedding-based recommendation and conventional recommendation in different tasks, and puts forward some open questions.}

This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},
